title: NJOYâ€”Nuclear Data Processing Code
---

This is the home page for NJOY, the nuclear data processing code developed at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov).

Two versions of NJOY are currently managed and distributed from this website:

 - [NJOY2016](NJOY2016.html) the legacy Fortran version that is familiar to long-time NJOY users, and
 - [NJOY21](NJOY21.html) the new version---written in C++---and backwards compatible with NJOY2016.

## Open Source Availability
For the first time, NJOY is freely available under the BSD 3-clause license. Both NJOY2016 and NJOY21 are **free to use**, but the copyright and license must remain with the code.

### Getting NJOY
Instructions for obtaining, compiling, and testing NJOY can be found [here](Build/).

### License
NJOY is released under the BSD 3-clause license. The license and copyright can
be found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file.
